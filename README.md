A simple app that does the following:

1) A web panel where the user can upload an image
2) Each image has a recommended size of 1024 x 1024.
3) Don’t upload the file if it’s not the right size.
4) Each image has to be converted into 4 different sizes. 
horizontal : 755 x 450
vertical : 365 x 450
horizontal small : 365 x 212
gallery : 380 x 380
Images should not be stretched, and they should be cropped properly. 

5) Save all 4 of these images locally on the server
6) Show a webpage with all 4 of these new images.

Bonus : Instead of saving these files to the server, upload them to a
cloud image hosting service.

Double Bonus : While uploading the image show a preview in the
browser itself of all the different image sizes, and let the user
decide how to crop the images to the smaller size.
